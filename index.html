        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! My name is Rolando Plata and welcome to my webpage! It‚Äôs awkward typing about myself since I don‚Äôt really like expressing or describing myself to a variety of people; however, I‚Äôd like to let you, the reader, learn more about me. To begin, I‚Äôm a really huge sports fan and have recently become in love with the NBA. My favorite team is the Los Angeles Lakers since I am a born and raised resident of the ‚ÄúCity of Angels‚Äù. I‚Äôm about 5‚Äô10 and unusually the tallest person in my family. I have 3 brothers, 2 sisters and 2 beautiful, but raging, dogs. I have spent my entire life living in La Puente, California and haven‚Äôt been outside of California, besides Las Vegas but who hasn‚Äôt been to Las Vegas? Right? I would like to consider myself a genuine person with a multitude of talents; with those talents including becoming a really quick learner under pressure, athletically gifted, writing efficiently gifted, etc,...you get the jist.<br><br>

        As of May of 2021, I am currently a first-year undergraduate student at the University of California, Riverside. I began looking into the University of California, Riverside through my senior year of high school. I realized and analyzed how great their business program was overall and realized that it‚Äôd be my best chance to graduate with a great GPA in order to get into law school. While looking into their Business program I came to realize that the business degree serves for a large portion of work areas, thus leaving me a multitude of choices for what I‚Äôd want to do with a degree and where to do it. However, since I was a young boy I have been attracted to the idea of becoming an attorney/lawyer due to the intensity that comes with the job and most importantly‚Ä¶ the money.<br><br>

        I also recently began my first official job at PRL Glass, INC. I would like to consider it my first official job, even though I have worked at 2 other companies and places in the past, due to the fact that I intend to stay at PRL Glass for some time, or at least until I earn enough money to buy myself a new car, and I officially receive paychecks instead of cash pay. I consider myself a glazier, ‚Äúsmart‚Äù word for glass manufacturer, because I work with making holes/cut-outs for (usually) shower doors and panels or complementary glass that will fit with shower doors and panels. Now, it‚Äôs not as easy as it sounds because I have to use sanders/seaming machines and saws to perfectly and efficiently create the cut-outs for glass. As a matter of fact, I recently cut a portion of my finger and finger nail off trying to sew sharp edges of glass. That seals the deal folks, hopefully you‚Äôve learned about me through this segment and became professionally attracted to what I can bring to the table if I have sufficient time to adapt. To be continued‚Ä¶.
